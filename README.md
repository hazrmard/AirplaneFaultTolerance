# Airplane Fault Tolerance

Using reinforcement learning to control hybrid systems under degradation. This repository/branch contains code for the following papers:

1. Ahmed, I., Qui√±ones-Grueiro, M. and Biswas, G. (2020). Fault-Tolerant Control of Degrading Systems with On-Policy Reinforcement Learning. IFAC-PapersOnLine.

## Project structure

* `IFAC Congress 2020`: Jupyter notebook containing code and results for experiments in IFAC 2020 paper.
* `tanks.py`: Definitions of the fuel tanks model and OpenAI `gym` environment classes for use in reinforcement learning.
* `utils.py`: Some function used in the notebook for data transformation, not relevant to theory.
* `plotting.py`: Functions for plotting graphs.
* `environment.yml`: Anaconda environment file for running the notebook.
